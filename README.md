Need to fix bug: code should not run if the letter was already successfully guessed.

Fixed bug that was causing the code to run even if the letter was already successfull by changing the condition on the if statement from:
if (lettersAlreadyGuessed.indexOf(guess) === -1 || hangmanWord.indexOf(guess) === -1) {
to the following condition statement:
if (lettersAlreadyGuessed.indexOf(guess) === -1 && hangmanWord.indexOf(guess) === -1) {
